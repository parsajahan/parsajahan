Hi, Iâ€™m parsa jahangiri pour. I am a biomedical engineer from Iran.
 
I have experience in repairing medical devices and intermidate level of programming in fields mentioned below. I have eagerness to learn and ability to gain new skills fast what may be found useful in the future.

I work with Python and Matlab on detection, classification and segmentation in medical signals and images. It can be applied in research as well as in a practical usage in medical devices.
 
In my free time I work with AVR micro controllers based on c language for simple projects and robotics. Hopefully it brings me closer to creating and designing medical devices in the future. I am advancing my knowledge of Python, Matlab and AVR as side activities and hobby but believe it might become my full time occupation.
 
In personal life I am engaged in animal support, especially stray dogs in my city.
